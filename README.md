ADS_Project_NicoNoah

This project will look at determinants of life satisfaction in a comparative stance over the countries of Europe. 
Special attention is put on pecuniary and non-pecuniary factors especially regarding work. As a first manual, users may 
start reading the paper on this page, it will lead through the application and the whole project. A quick overview: 
A_Data preparation and B_Variable preparation are all about loading and wrangling with the data from our various sources.
C_Analysis and D_Visualisation are used to provide important preparations for our paper and the application. Z_Backup 
holds code that we did not use in the end but still think of potentially useful. Finally, the file 
"European_Happiness_Observer" contains the code file "app" that can be used to launch the centrepiece of our project, 
a reactive shiny visualisation interface. The whole project is designed such that every code file could be run 
independently, without the other, given the necessary data files. But even with only the intial data, the whole project
can be recreated by running the files in alphabetical order.

We are still experimenting with data access (currently on the drive), so please contact us if you 
are especially interested.

We hope this project may be benficial for those who are interested (or must read it for professional purposes).

Greetings,
Nico & Noah
